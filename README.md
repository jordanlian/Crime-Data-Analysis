# Crime-Data-Analysis
### Final Project for Probability and Statistics
We chose to use the crimedata library from R, where we pulled all crime from 2019 to analyze. 
We compared crimes by city and by month, and used some statistical tests to draw some conclusions we would not have thought of.
Some of the tests include hypothesis tests, T-tests, confidence intervals, etc.
We also generated some visuals, including crime rates by month, crime rates by city, and a heat map for salary vs crime.
